- Now, click on the top part of the arduino (the connector), and the extrude distance will snap to this point. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/1b9pOe6.png)
- Go to the dialog box, and add '+4' to the extrude distance
    - (Or `-4` - this depends on the direction of your first extrude. Important is you are ADDING a distance.)

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/QIMpuoj.png)
- Extrude the inside part of the sketch 4 mm up
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/tCI5E5R.png)

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/a6GxaVd.png)
- Extrude the inner sketch INTO the model, cutting it. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/YC4rzoN.png)

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/vbmDhFz.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/GMDp0Yv.png)
- Now we **have a simple Arduino Box!**
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/r8Iyg5a.png)

## However! Part Two:

- We are not finished. When we look closely, there's a few things we need to do to make the box actually working. We need to make a few adjustments. 
- There are **THREE** more things we need to do to make this box work. Can you figure out what they are and how to do them? (Read on for a solution.)

### Add more space on the bottom and top.
- We forgot to compensate for the thickness of the wall. There's a a clear overlap on the bottom between the arduino (and its pins) and the box. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/ONWdwYv.png)
-  To fix this issue, right click on the the first command, offset plane, and go in to editing mode. 
    - Change it to 6.5mm (3+3.5 (thickness of the box))
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/T2DwFq4.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/JsgWZwS.png)
- That's clearly better. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/bwhYe6i.png)
- Now, on the top, simply edit the first extrusion. Add another 3.5mm to the extruded length, totalling now 23 mm.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/QUHsMaZ.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/6tioVwh.png)
- Now the arduino has space both above and below. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/foGi82z.png)
 
 ### Add 'tolerance' between the upper and the lower half. 
 
- We're going to 3D print our box, and 3D printing adds a bit of imprecision into the mix. We need to design a small space (about 0.2mm) between the  walls so that the two halves actually fit together. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8pxJym3.png)
- Hide the top part. 
- Go back and edit the sketch on in the middle.
    - Make a new offset, this time 1.6mm
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/irZZasU.png)
    - Now we have two lines, 0.2 mm apart
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/lLBUVj2.png)
- Go back and edit the last extrusion. 
    - Click on this 0.2 mm strip we just created to add it to the extrusion. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jFCHAYf.png)
- Unhide the top and see, there is now 0.2mm gap between the parts!
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/G3UeoKd.png)

### Cutout holes for connectors
- Lastly, we need to cutout space for the connectors. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Gm9RaRd.png)
- Hide the 'section analysis'
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/2CGCEBd.png)
- Make a new sketch on the boxe's side face where the connectors are
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/y7G6UEO.png)
- Since we started a sketch on a face and not on a plane, 'new sketch' automatically also makes a projection of the face onto the sketch. We don't want that now. Select everything and press delete. Now we have an empty sketch. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/yvezdYh.png)
- Select the Project tool and project the USB connector. Simply click on its face.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/DWalkst.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jahg3OQ.png)
- Hide the bodies
- Continue using the Project tool to project the power connector. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8aWZt5x.png)
- Let's add some tolerance to both projections with the offset tool. Maybe 0.4 mm ?
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/llKCrcs.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kr9Ptgk.png)
- Double click on the inside project rectangle to select it. Then, right click, and select 'Construction geometry'. This makes the shape visible - dotted line -  but it will be hidden to commands like extrude, which will make it easier to work with. 
    - You can hide the arduino to see the sketch easier. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/PlKfVhV.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/gdUYPCS.png)
- Do the same for the other connector. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0KfgSv9.png)
- Delete other superfluous inside geometry. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/FSB18kS.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CJyMRD3.png)
- Stop the sketch and Unhide the bodies. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/XP2FVeJ.png)
- Extrude both sketch profiles into the bodies to 'cut' the holes. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/b4Pa7Cn.png)
- Tadaaaa! We got a probably functional arduino case!

- Bonus: You can select the outside edges, and add a 0.8 mm 'chamfer' to make the box look cooler and smoother. 
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/R4cBTdj.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/uecw8Yz.png)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/sDwGJqG.png)
- PS: Now would be the time to make another sketch on the top face, and add some custom super cool cutouts! That's up to you. PS: you can import dxf or svg files from Inkscape or Illustrator...
- What would a design be without some cool?
