## == SPEAK intro

I don't like when teachers talk at the beginning of the class. I prefer for the students to start working right away. You're not here to listen to me speak. You're here to learn a hands-on skill. And for that, you have to use your hands as much as possible.

However, it is also strange to be in a room with complete strangers.

So, I will introduce myself and the class as briefly as possible.
Then, we'll work.
Then, there will be a break. 
Then, I'll speak some more about what we will be doing in the upcoming classes and so on. 
And then we will work again. 
And then we'll go home.

### Digital fabrication: new art class

Digital fabrication is the new art class. Tools that were once expensive and available only to engineers and design professionals are now available to us. The regular people. 

This is empowering. We can create high quality, professional looking, precise physical objects with ease. And that feels good. 

In your many ACPR courses, you are creating projects with physical outcomes.  You need to use lasercutters and 3D printers and regular inkjet printers to create objects.

Downstairs in HEP we have a lasercutter, 3d printers, vinyl cutters and more. But these are just computer controlled tools, and therefore they need very precise instructions. 

2D tools need 2D instructions, and that's what we do here.

### This class

In this class, ACPR 2.1, we will learn how to use Inkscape to make digital 2D drawings. Shapes. That's it. 

This class is concerned with the software. We will do little projects, but it is not our main goal. Our goal is to be able to use the software so that you can work on the projects for your other classes. 

Next year, in ACPR 3.1, you will have a similar class learning to make 3D digital file. 3D models. 

### Who am I and why you should trust me? 

2D and 3D design and 'making' is what I do for living. 

I'm an educator, a bit like you. I have a degree in designing courses with innovative technologies, and I have taught a wide range of classes in several countries. 

Two years ago, in the US, I have co-founded a company making 3D printers for education. I have co-designed the 3D printer JellyBOX. I did both the 3D design (for 3D printing) and 2D design (for lasercutting). My machine won the "Best for Schools" award by the make magazine last year.

I come from the Czech Republic, but I lived in the US for the past 8 year. I just moved here recently. 

### Language Issues

Which brings me to the issue of language.

As teachers, you know that sometimes, you may have a student who does not speak or understand French very well. 

In this class, joke is on you. It's the teacher who is is struggling. 

I learnt some french a long time ago when I was a teenager, and I'm only recently re-learning.

Well, nothing is perfect. Some times you may get a teacher who speaks well, but knows nothing. Other times, you get someone who know what they're doing, but cannot speak well. I think we'll be fine. Just ask me slowly, or better SHOW me what you need, and I will answer slowly, or SHOW you the answer.

Also, my english is perfect, if at any point we can't make it work. 

### Learning software - the Trouble

Learning software in a classroom environment is a terrible idea. Everyone is not comfortable with computers in the same way, and everyone learns at different speed.

Plus, working on a computer is solitary and we need to stare at our screens. 

If we try to work together on something - let's say I would be showing something on a big screen and you follow along - then necessarily some people will be bored to death while for others it will be too fast to understand. 

Still, a big screen demonstration is nice to show how one interacts with the program in a real time.

So, I will show you the basics of the interface and how one moves around. Then, you will get your own exercise files, and you you will be working alone. 

I will be walking around and observing you. Your job is to tell me when you need help. I will show you on your computer.

This way, different people will learn different things at different speeds. At the end of the class, you may have different skills. Welcome to the real world. 

### Importance of Self-Learning

This class is by NO means a comprehensive training. It can't be. 

It is a focused, goal-driven introduction designed to get you MAKING things.

You probably need at least ten hours before you'll be reasonably proficient with this software. We don't have that much time. 

If you need a skill we do not cover or if you want to become good, you will need to do some learning on your own. I'll send you a list of good resources, but it's often best to find your own. 

At the end of the day, googling a video or tutorial on how to do a specific thing may be the most authentic way to learn. The internet is full of guides. 

## == CLASS SPECIFIC

We only have 4 sessions together.

2 sessions as a whole class, and 2 sessions for group work. 

Here's the plan. It's subject to change depending on what happens in your other ACPR2 classes. 

1. Today, we'll jump into Inkscape right away and see how far we get. We'll cover the interface, and basic tools to create and manipulate basic shapes.
2. Next week, we will cover tips and tricks, and learn to work more efficiently. We will ALSO create a small project using Silhouette Cameo - which is a digitally controlled cutter.
 - All these skills you will need for in ACPR 2.2 with Adrienne and Isa. You will be using cameo to cut as early as your first class with them. 
3. Our first group session, I will be helping you work with your project that you will bring from the ACPR 2.2 class. The theme this year is upcycling. 
4. Our second group session, we will focus on creating text layouts, which will come handy for your ACPR2 evaluation. Also, for fun, we will learn to use the laser cutter as as preparation for your ACT3D class with Dino. We will be working on generating patterns.

### Evaluation

This is a foundational class. The skills you learn here you will need in most of your other ACPR2 and even ACPR3 classes.

There is no separate evaluation for this class.

Evaluation will be done for all the ACPR2 modules together. Sebastien Actis-Datta is the one who does the assessment, and he will tell you all about it in two weeks when you have class with him.

### Communication

- You can reach me at fgoc@fablab-hepl.ch
  - Do NOT hesitate to email me. There will be long long gaps between our classes; email will be the best way to reach me.
- I am also at the fablab on Thursdays. I am inviting you to stop by and work on your things if you wish.
- Course materials will be listed on Moodle
- I made a website specifically for this class, a link is on Moodle. 
- (it's `https://filipgoc.github.io/hep-cad`)

So, let's get get started. 

## What is Inkscape?

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a graphics program which can be
used to create **vector graphics**. It’s **open source** (i.e. everybody
can look into [the program’s code](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/inkscape/trunk/files)),
it is licenced under a **free licence**, which allows everyone to change
the program’s code, to use the program for any purpose and to share it
with others, and it is constantly being improved by a **community of
committed volunteer developers**. Many users also support Inkscape – for
example by helping other users.

This means that, in contrast to many other computer programs, there is
**no company** behind Inkscape, but a community of volunteers from all
over the world, with an elected board committee and an umbrella
organization ([Software Freedom Conservancy](http://sfconservancy.org/)), which creates a safe judicial
context for the activities of the contributors (e.g. in order to make it
possible that the project can accept donations).

Everyone who contributes to this project becomes part of the
**world-wide [Inkscape community](https://inkscape.org/community/)**.

## What is a Vector Graphic?

Vector graphics consist of separate **objects**. These are defined by
their **geometric properties**, e.g. a circle by the position of its
center and the size of its radius. For curved lines, specific properties
are saved which describe the position of certain points on them and the
curvature of the lines which connect these points to each other.

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/stars.jpg){:width="650px"}

Objects in a vector graphic all have a well-defined **set of attributes**, each of which can easily be modified. This allows you to
change the color of the fill or the contour line with a single click to
some completely different color, to remove it or even replace it by
a pattern.

**Examples of these attributes** are: fill color, fill pattern, fill
with a color gradient, color of the contour (stroke), width of the
contour, contour pattern, type of contour line (e.g. dashed, dotted, …)
or the type of markers (e.g. arrows or other symbols) used in the course
of the path.

## A Comparison: Vector Graphic vs. Raster Graphic 

### Always Crisp

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/crisp_vs_pixelated.jpg){:width="650px"}

A vector graphic behaves **very differently from, for example, a photo**, that was taken with a digital camera. Digital photos are
**raster graphics**, and thus consist of a large number of colored dots,
which are arranged in a specific order (the raster). When the distance
is large enough, all those little dots together form an image. But as
soon as the photo is enlarged a little too much, all those single dots
become visible – the image appears ‘pixelated’.

Because vector graphics are saved as instructions for the geometrical
construction of the objects they contain (just like a set of geometry
homework assignments), the computer needs to calculate all objects
first, to be able to show them on the screen.

When viewing a vector image, it doesn’t matter how much you zoom in – it
will never look pixelated. The computer can precisely calculate all the
pixels that are needed in order to display the image on your monitor,
for every zoom level. This is why a vector graphic is **always crisp**
(unless you intentionally add some blur, of course).

### Easy to change

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/change.jpg){:width="650px"}

In comparison to raster graphics, it’s very easy to **radically change** the appearance of a vector graphic by changing only very few of its properties (see image). In a raster graphic, to change the color, you'd basically have to find a way to paint over the old color - like with a physical brush on a physical painting. 

### Smaller file sizes – more computational work

Vector graphics – as long as they only contain a reasonable number of
objects – only need **very little disk space**, because the color
information does not need to be saved for each and every pixel, but only
**once per object**. This is an advantage for images that are meant to
be used on web pages, resulting in smaller amounts of data transferred
and the web page to load quickly.

On the other hand, it can take longer to **prepare** highly complex
vector images for displaying them on a monitor.

### Different types of images for different purposes

Raster and vector graphics are each used for different purposes which
**complement each other**.

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/photo_raster_und_vektor-o.jpg){:width="650px"}

**Raster images** are used for images with **a large amount of irregular, differently colored contents**, so mainly for **photos**. If we wanted to save those in a vector format, trying to render them on a monitor would take very long. Depending upon how much we would then need to simplify the image because of slow rendering, there would also be a lesser amount of different colors in it and the quality would be much worse. In addition to this, at the same level of image quality, the file size would be enourmous, as for each color that appears in the image, a separate object would need to be created (this could be up to 1.9 million objects for a normal 1600x1200 pixel sized photo, if every pixel had a different color).

This is why **vector images** are most often used for **logos, clipart, buttons, icons** and other graphics, which are made up of **large, coherent single-color areas** or can easily be divided into **single objects**. Of course, depending upon the subject of the drawing, it is also possible to create very realistic looking drawings, which create the impression of 3D depth by skillful use of color gradients.

So, before you jump straight into Inkscape to create the image of your
dreams, you should first have a think if Inkscape is the **appropriate tool for the task**. If your goal is to edit a photo, or to draw a
large, realistic image as you would do with a brush on canvas, then
there exists other software which is more suitable (e.g. [The Gimp](http://gimp.org) to edit photos or [Krita](http://krita.org/) to
draw digital paintings using different brushes. Both of these are – just
like Inkscape – open source projects.).

## What is SVG?

SVG is a **file format for vector graphics**. The abbreviation
stands for “Scalable Vector Graphics” – resizable images that are made
up of vector data. Inkscape uses this file format because it is an
**open standard**, so the files you create with Inkscape can be **used universally**. Web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or
Microsoft Edge, but also lots of other programs, support this standard.

This offers the advantage that images you have created in Inkscape are
not ‘lost’ when Inkscape is not available. In most cases, those images
can, for example, be **embedded directly into a web page** without
needing to do any changes, or **other programs** (e.g. an office suite,
or a desktop publishing program) can open the files, and you can
continue to edit them there.

The organisation which sets the svg standard, is the **[World Wide Web Consortium [W3C](http://www.w3.org/)** – that same
organisation which also works on the standards for HTML or
CSS (the languages used to write and design web pages).

One of the Inkscape developers is a member of the SVG Working
Group of the W3C. There, he represents Inkscape and its
interests and helps improving the SVG standard even further.

### Basic elements

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/elements.jpg){:width="650px"}

The SVG file format supports a number of **basic elements**,
from which images can be constructed. These are (among others)
**straight lines**, **polylines** (consisting of multiple straight lines
which are connected to each other), **paths** (composed of one or more
curved lines), **circles**, **ellipses**, **rectangles**, **polygons**,
**texts**, **raster graphics** (yes, these can also be used inside an
[SVG]!) and **copies of other objects** (the exact same object is
used multiple times in the drawing, but only the original can be edited
in a substantial way).

> Inkscape does not use all available elements – e.g. straight lines or polygons are saved as ‘paths’, too. In exchange for this, Inkscape offers some additional elements, though. For example there are stars and spirals – which are saved in two formats in parallel by Inkscape: first as a normal path (in order to allow for other programs to read them correctly), secondly as a star/spiral with specific properties (length of star tips, number of spiral turns, etc., which makes it possible to change these properties with just a few mouse clicks).

### Stacking order

Objects in an SVG image are stacked on top of each other in a
specific **order** – just like in a collage, for example. This is why it
is possible that there are objects in your drawing which are completely
**hidden** by another object (see image).

Even if it may look as if two objects are just lying there next to each other, each of them ‘knows’ exactly at which **level in the stacking order** it is currently. An object can never be at the same time **above *and* below** another object (think of a loop in a knot). If you would like to draw something like that, you need to compose the object **from multiple parts**, which then can be positioned above and below the other object.

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kGMcF9vq9s?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The animation shows how an object that at first was covered by other
objects becomes visible when the other objects are moved away, and that
the stacking order is preserved even after dragging the objects apart.

Of course, you can change the stacking order in Inkscape. Newly created
objects are always placed on top.

### Plain Text / Tree Structure

And what does an SVG image look like now?

Like this:

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/svgcode-rect.svg){:width="650px"}

Or, in a text editor, the same image will look like this:

_(No kidding. This code below actually renders this rectangle. Note that I manually deleted all sorts of metadata and useful information, but it still works. Simple.)_

```
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:inkscape="http://www.inkscape.org/namespaces/inkscape" >

  <rect
  style="opacity:1;vector-effect:none;fill:#3465a4;fill-opacity:0.96832581;fill-rule:evenodd;stroke:none;stroke-width:0.238125;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0;stroke-opacity:1"
  id="rect44547"
  width="103.70058"
  height="42.763123"
  x="78.042702"
  y="45.766644"
  rx="0.20325899"
  ry="0.20325899" />
  
</svg>
```

Everyone who ever looked at the **source code of a web page** will
probably recognize the structure of the file – the reason for the
likeness being that both kinds of files, HTML and SVG,
are based on **XML**. This is a markup language, that has a
**tree-like structure** (elements nested inside each other) and where
each element starts with `<something>` and ends with `</something>` – or
it may also just look like
`<something and-a-long-list-of-properties />`, when it doesn’t have any
further contents, but only properties.

The advantage of this kind of formatting is that it can be read
reasonably well **by both a computer and a human** (as the SVG
‘language’ uses English names, you should be able to read English,
though). You probably realized by now that `<rect...` defines a rectangle and its properties. 

It can easily be edited **automatically** by different kinds of
programs. This allows, for example, to **quickly and programatically** exchange names in
visitor passes, or numbers in admission tickets which you want to print.
There exist a host of small helper programs which can support you in
such a task.

It’s also possible to unproblematically make little changes by hand to
such a file, for example, to prepare it for making animations from it.

Still, most people will probably prefer to edit their drawings using
**the mouse or a graphics tablet**, so they can see right away how their
picture changes – and that’s what you can use **Inkscape** for ;)

## Examples

To give you a small impression of what kind of images are possible with Inkscape, below, there’s a set of **examples** for you. If you are curious to see more of these, you should absolutely visit the **[gallery with drawings made by Inkscape users](https://inkscape.org/gallery/)** at the Inkscape website and also browse a little in the **[Openclipart Library](https://openclipart.org/)**. Especially the latter offers a wonderful opportunity to **learn from other users**, by downloading the images and **‘dissecting’ them in Inkscape**, to find out how to create specific effects.

### Simple Objects

### Buttons and Icons with Color Gradients

### Complex Drawings with mostly natural-looking Shading

![](/assets/media/noob-imgs/things4.jpg){:width="650px"}


### Animations

Applications such as [sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr/), Inkscape extensions like JessyInk or different JavaScript libraries allow to create **animations** or **presentations**, which can be viewed using a web browser. The markup languages **CSS** and **SMIL** can also be used to animate SVG images. An introduction into this topic can be found [at the Inkscape website](https://inkscape.org/en/learn/animation/).

### Plotters, Cutters and Co.

There are many people who do not use Inkscape to create nice graphics,
but to mill, automatically cut, paint etc. **physical objects**. For
example, you could use Inkscape (with an Inkscape extension) to control
**film cutting appliances** or to burn **decorations into wood using a
laser**. It is also a great tool to use for **painting eggs** ;-)

## Can we finally start now?

In this article, we have laid the **foundations** for understanding
vector graphics. These will help you to not become confused by the
differences in relation to the familiar raster graphics / photo editing
when you are working in Inkscape.

As a next step, you should **install** Inkscape on your computer. The **current version** for **Windows** and **Mac OS** can freely be downloaded [from the Inkscape website](https://inkscape.org/download/). For **Linux distributions**, the website offers the [source code](https://inkscape.org/download/), and there is a [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable) for Ubuntu and its derivatives at launchpad.

> If you experience problems during installation, you should first read the instructions on the download page slowly again. If this doesn’t help, and a web search also doesn’t return any useful information, you can ask for help in an [Inkscape forum](https://inkscape.org/community/), in the [Chat](https://inkscape.org/community/) or in the [answers section](https://answers.launchpad.net/inkscape) at launchpad.

---

After you have finished the installation, we will hopefully meet
again for **[Part II - Practice](noobs2.md)**.
