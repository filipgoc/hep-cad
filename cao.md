## drawing to 3D design

Cette classe concerne la création de modèles 3D numériques dans Fusion360.

Going from a hand drawing to a digital computer drawing with Inkscape or Illustrator is relatively straightforward. You need a line, you draw a line.

Transforming a hand drawing or an idea of an object into a 3D model is not as natural.

Basically, every creation will have three stages. 

1. Imagine the design. Make some drawings with a pen. (This really helps to protect you from the limitations of the software.)
2. Figure out in your head what kinds of mathematical 3D modeling functions you could use to make the object. Usually there are many different solutions, and they all change the way the model will behave.
3. Try to make the object.

Stage one is the design and idea.

! Stage two is what we are mostly dealing with in this class. Learning how to get the objects from your head into the computer with using software.

## We'll be using Fusion360

There are many 3D modeling programs just like there are many word processors, many accounting programs, many chat apps, or many 2D drawing programs. 

The beauty of Fusion360 is that 

- it is free for hobbyists
- it is a complete package. 
  - it can be used for design, manufacturing, and all the various steps that come in between.
  - it features many different kinds of modeling
  - and on and on and on

Depending on your needs, Fusion360 may not always be the right tool however. For example, it's not the best tool for young children - that would be TinkerCAD. I'll post a document listing some other 3D modeling tools to check out on Moodle, so feel free to check it out. 

## Evaluation

You will use the skills from this class in many other courses; specifically ACELP with Sebastien and Adrien Actis-Datta and ACPR3.2 with Sebastien and I think maybe Dino. 

The assessment will be your final project and your ability to make it.

## Plan of Attack

What do we do when.

  - Send Filip your autodesk ID email to `fgoc@fablab-hepl.ch`
- Projects, Data management, cloud, online management, offline mode

- Navigation
  - Open some file. The knife in Inspiration.
  - rotate
  - zoom
  - pan
  - view cube
- components and bodies. visibility
- customize the bar above
- right click
  - right click and drag
- `s` toolbox. amazing. 
- timeline
  - make a new object in real time. 
  - what you see is a computation. from beginning to the end. fusion360 constructs an elaborate equation and renders a 3d model as the result. 
  - we can go back and change the variables in the equation. we can go back in time. using the timeline. or replay the history. 
  - of course this is incredibly powerful and it's the basis of so called 'parametric modeling' and is popular with engineers. there are other kinds of modeling, and we'll talk about them later.


## Sketching & constraints

Drawing in Fusion360 is not like Illustrator or Inkscape. Here it's about parameters - variables. In sketches, this translates into constraints (things like `parallel`, `right angle`, `5mm long`.)

This makes sketching a bit more time consuming and less natural, but it allows us to make absolutely precise drawings that are easy to modify. 

Let's explore some constraints and sketch tools at the same time. 

You can see the finished file in the "Screencasts" folder in our shared Fusion360 hub.

## basic solid modeling tools

Let's make a simple cylinder in 7 different ways - thus exploring the basic tools of 3D trade. 

You can see the finished file in the "Screencasts" folder in our shared Fusion360 hub. (Don't forget you can see the history of how the cylinders were made. Priceless when you don't know what to do.)

## EXERCISE: Wrench

Look at the model of wrench in the "Exercise" folder.
Use the timeline to figure out exactly how it was made.

## EXERCISE: Carriage bolt

Model a carriage bolt in at least two different ways. 

Ask Filip and he'll give you a bolt to hold. 

Help: 
- There is a 'thread' tool. 

## EXERCISE: Android

Look at the model of Android robot in the "Exercise" folder. 

Make one just like it :-)
