## drawing to 3D design

Cette classe concerne la création de modèles 3D numériques dans Fusion360.

Going from a hand drawing to a digital computer drawing with Inkscape or Illustrator is relatively straightforward. You need a line, you draw a line.

Transforming a hand drawing or an idea of an object into a 3D model is not as natural.

Basically, every creation will have three stages. 

1. Imagine the design. Make some drawings with a pen. (This really helps to protect you from the limitations of the software.)
2. Figure out in your head what kinds of mathematical 3D modeling functions you could use to make the object. Usually there are many different solutions, and they all change the way the model will behave.
3. Try to make the object.

Stage one is the design and idea.

! Stage two is what we are mostly dealing with in this class. Learning how to get the objects from your head into the computer with using software.

## We'll be using Fusion360

There are many 3D modeling programs just like there are many word processors, many accounting programs, many chat apps, or many 2D drawing programs. 

The beauty of Fusion360 is that 

- it is free for hobbyists
- it is a complete package. 
  - it can be used for design, manufacturing, and all the various steps that come in between.
  - it features many different kinds of modeling
  - and on and on and on

Depending on your needs, Fusion360 may not always be the right tool however. For example, it's not the best tool for young children - that would be TinkerCAD. I'll post a document listing some other 3D modeling tools to check out on Moodle, so feel free to check it out. 

## Evaluation

You will use the skills from this class in many other courses; specifically ACELP with Sebastien and Adrien Actis-Datta and ACPR3.2 with Sebastien and I think maybe Dino. 

The assessment will be your final project and your ability to make it.

## Plan of Attack

What do we do when.
