Last week I had a few people ask me why are we learning this, and how is this tool going to be useful to me or my students.

I think that's an essential question and I am terribly sorry that I didn't answer it to your satisfaction. I thought that this question was already answered by your teachers in other classes - since this is purely a 'tools' class (something like the equivalent of knife skills class for new cooks). 

That was my mistake. Let me remedy it.

It is not necessarily an easy answer. Some responses may go as deep and far as to talk about what is the role of arts and crafts in education. What is creativity,  what is the value of creativity, and what is the place of creativity in education.  

We could have a whole semester reading educational philosophy and fighting over these ideas. And maybe we should - put it on the forum. 

Let me still give you the ethos of this class, or the PIRACEF digital creation axis, as I see it. 

This class is about offering you the possibility to discover a new way to interact with this world you live in. You can think of it as the 'arts and crafts' class for the 21st century. 

Of course you don't need computers to make things or to be creative. I love woodworking and traditional crafts and I think many people may enjoy working with the hands in addition to working with computers. 

But we live in a designed world.

We are surrounded by objects made with the help of computers. This is our reality and even more it is the reality of our children. Anything from your smartphone to this table to the signage on your T-shirt was most likely designed with the help of a computer program and made with some sort of digital manufacturing process. This is the 21st century; this is the world we live in.

And make no mistakes, the digital natives as we like to call them, the kids, they live in this world. In some ways, we are just trying to catch up.

Who said it, that any technology sufficiently  advanced will always be perceived as magic by the uninitiated - or, by the ones who don't understand. 

It is supremely important to me to disperse the magic.

Because there isn't any magic. It's just computers.  And they are relatively simple, you just need to know how to talk to them. And then, you become the magicians,  you get the superpowers. You get the ability to change your natural surroundings. You get a chance to live in this world of designed digital things as an actor, as an agent, not just as a confused and amazed spectator.

That's what this class is about. We are trying to help you get a taste of how things work and how things are made today.

And we are not coming to you from the future. This is already happening all around us.  How many schools in just Lausanne do the you think purchased a 3-D printer this year. How many students go to fablabs and makerspaces in their spare time to  program a digital sewing machine to make a professional looking logo on their favorite hoodie. How many students in their free time make little digital animations or draw comics on their iPads. 

The goals are simple. You will come and see that these things are not magic, and that you can use them for your own personal projects  to do things you couldn't imagine possible,  professional looking files and things, with relative ease.  

More importantly, this is an opportunity to discover that you may like having this superpower. That it's satisfying to make things like this. That it makes you feel accomplished and proud. Think of this class as a hobby. That's how I see it. 

Of course, if that wasn't clear, everything I said here that applies to you,  applies your students.
