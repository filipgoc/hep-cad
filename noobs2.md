## **[Download the workshop file](#)**
  
   and to open it with Inkscape. Keep your browser window open to be able to switch between the two applications.

  Here in your web browser, you can **read the explanations** and **watch the animations**, while in Inkscape, you can **try out your new knowledge** right away.

  This tutorial is quite long, and contains a really huge amount of information. 
  
  > We will take a **15 minute break** at **14:30 **
  
  > In addition, while in this individual-work mode, **get up and stretch anytime you need.** It's your time, it's your life.

## HOWTO properly use the the Animations/ Screencasts

  Many of the screencasts are embedded as YouTube videos, because this provides a flexible and practical **playback options.**
  
  > DO try these shortcuts. It will change the way you watch Youtube forever. 
 
 There's a trick you have to do: 
 
  1. click on the play to load the video
  2. when the video loads, _click again_ to pause it
  3. now use shortcuts. (Spacebar to play.)

  action            | shortcut
  ------------------|--------------
  **pause/ play**       | `spacebar`
  **jump 5s back** <br> (use this when you can't follow and need to re-watch the last step !)      | `left arrow`  
  jump 5s forward   | `right arrow`
  speed up          | `shift + >`
  **slow down** <br> (use this when you can't follow !)        | `shift + <`
  one frame forward | `.`
  one frame back    | `,`
  **fullscreen**  <br> (use this when to switch to full and back fast)      | `doubleclick`

## The Inkscape Window

  After you have opened the file, you should be seeing something like this (minus the docked dialog on the right side, as you haven't opened any yet):

  ![Overview about the Inkscape window](/assets/media/inkscape.jpg)

  At the very top of the window, there are the different **menus**, which give you access to a tremendous amount of different functions and dialogs. **Take your time to take a look around**, so you can get a rough first impression of all the possibilities Inkscape has to offer. **Don't be afraid**, even if at first, all these terms you will see may seem confusing!
  
  When you **hover-over items**, there are **tooltips** that tell you what these functions are, and what are the shortcuts to invoke them. (Unfortunately, the shortcuts are sometimes wrong on Mac so look elsewhere as needed.)

## Saving your drawing 

  As you are working on your files, get in the habit of periodically **saving** your work. That way, you won't lose your work if the program or computer crashes. 

  Save files as **Inkscape SVG**. This will keep the data Inkscape needs to make editing the files comfortable for you (guidelines, grids, editable stars and many more).

  save file | `ctrl + s`

  We'll cover saving to different file formats next time. 

## Moving around the Document 

### Scrolling

  There are a range of options available for **moving the canvas**. You can:
  
on Mac, two-finger drag in any direction | move around
move the **mouse wheel** (hold `Shift` for going sideways) | move around
use the **scroll bars** | move around
hold down the `space bar` and move the mouse | move around

  Now try all these different variants yourself – maybe you already know which one will be your favorite method?

### Zooming

  For setting the current zoom level, again, Inkscape offers different ways how to do it:

  - hold `Ctrl` down and **turn the mouse wheel**.
    - on Mac, hold `ctrl` and two finger scroll.
  - use the **zoom tool** (`z`) from the tool box at the left
    - on Mac, `ctrl + two finger click` zooms in and `shift + two finger click` zooms out
  - Numbers zoom to preset values. Try them all. 
    - `5` will zoom to page
    - `4` will zoom to the whole drawing
    - `3` to the selected object
    - `6` to the page width
  >This one is essential for our workshop file. anytime you need to 'RESET' your zoom level to reading, use `6`
  - When you hold down the `q` key, the current view area will be _temporarily_ zoomed to be twice as large, or, if an object is selected, to the object.

## SELF WORK START

**Follow along in in the workshop file.**
**If you can't make something work, ask me and I'll help you.** 

## Shortcuts 

Don't just click on tool to activate it. If you can't remember the shortcut, have a look, and then use it. Learning a program like Inkscape is partly just learning a LOT of keyboard shortcuts.

### The Selection Tool

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vO8kt8geo2k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  With the **selection tool**, you can **select** objects (obviously ;-) ).
  
  Hold `Shift` | to **add more objects to the selection**.

  The tool also can be used to:

  - **move** objects with mouse
  - **change their size** (hold `Ctrl` to preserve the aspect ratio),
  - **skew** and
  - **rotate** objects (when you hold `Ctrl` while rotating, the object will be rotated in the preset 15° steps (can be changed in the preferences)).
  
  move objects with arrows 
  and ctrl + arrows

  Now try to move, rotate and scale the red rectangle to make it fit into the dashed frames. To enter the rotation mode, click a second time on a selected object. Also resize the rectangle while keeping its aspect ratio.

### The Node Tool 

  <iframe width="500" height="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUyhMp0PcEQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  You can use the node tool to **edit paths**. **Click** with it on the rectangle at the top to select it. Now **drag** the bottom right node to change the shape of the rectangular path to fit the dashed shape.

  **Drag** on one of the connecting lines (a **path segment**) between two nodes of the rectangle in the middle to change its shape. Also try out what happens when you drag the two **handles** of a node to modify the shape the neighbouring path segment (if you have a totally straight path segment, these handles **aren't visible** (they are 'retracted'), but you can just drag a tiny bit on the path segment to make them show up.).

  On the last rectangle, experiment with **automatic rounding**. In order to do so, select all nodes by dragging a **selection rectangle** (also called rubberband selection) around them with the mouse. Now click on the button `Make selected nodes auto-smooth` in the tool control bar at the top. Its corners look a lot smoother now, right?

### The Rectangle Tool 

  <iframe width="500" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmQgo3-MEcM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  Use the **The rectangle tool** to create **squares and rectangles**, optionally with rounded corners. Just **click** with it on the canvas and **drag** with the mouse to create a rectangle.

  If you would prefer to draw a **square**, hold the `Ctrl` key down while dragging.

  If you **continue to drag**, while holding down the `Ctrl` key, the rectangle will 'jump' to the next **whole-number width-to-height** ratio. Keep an eye on the **status bar** – the width-to-height ratio is displayed there!

  To **round the corners** of a rectangle, pull on the little **circle** in its upper right corner. Now, another circle-shaped handle will appear. If you drag that one, the corner rounding will become asymmetrical.

  The **square-shaped handles** allow you to change the size of the rectangle.

### The Ellipse Tool

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48GVM8GdbGs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  The ellipse tool creates **circles, ellipses, arcs and circle segments**. It almost works in the same way as the rectangle tool.

  Now fill the dashed shapes with ellipses and a circle. Remember the status bar!

  To create **circle segments** and **arcs**, pull on the round handles. Note the difference between the result you get when the mouse is **inside** or **outside** the ellipse while dragging!

  The **square-shaped** handles will, again, change the size.

### Stars and Polygons 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AN4PSoPGkY0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  The **star tool** is useful for **polygons.**

  At the top, in its tool controls bar, you can choose if you want to draw a **star** or a **regular polygon**. You can also use these buttons to turn a star into a polygon and back again.

  The **number of corners or tips** can also be set there.

  Now **play around with the tool** – drag on **all handles** that you can find and watch what happens. If you succeed to create the right-most model, you'll get an **extra special bonus point** ;-)

### Bézier curves and lines 

  <iframe width="500" height="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/otE3HppQPLE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  Use the **Bézier tool** to draw very exact **Paths** (that is, arbitrary shapes, which consist of [Bézier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)). If you just click with it on the canvas, you create a single **node**. A second click creates another node and a straight line between the two nodes. Try it! A **right-click** will finish the path. Or, you can click on the **start node** to **close** the path.

  If, for some reason, you would like to draw **only vertical or horizontal lines**, you can select this in the tool controls bar at the top.

  You can also try what happens when, instead of repeatedly clicking on the canvas, you **hold the mouse button down and drag**, and only click after this (don't use the 'vertical/horizontal' line mode, but the first, normal mode!). I find it a little difficult to control this behaviour, but maybe you will enjoy it!

  And what's that second button in the tool control bar for? See what happens if you create a **spiro path**!

  After they are finished by right-clicking, all paths you create with this tool can be edited at will **using the node tool**.

  **Selection tool, Bézier tool and node tool** together are probably the most important tools when you want to create a real drawing. So absolutely try to memorize the keyboard shortcuts for these three tools: `s`, `b` and `n` (or you can use the shortcuts displayed in their tooltips – those will work, too, but I find them a little more difficult to reach). This wasn't so hard now, was it?

### Pencil tool 

  <iframe width="500" height="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B71Yp-AY3Xk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  The **pencil tool** also draws paths. It is best used with a graphics tablet. If you are using a mouse, you should set the **smoothing** to a higher value in the tool bar, so your drawing will look less 'scrawly'. **Click and drag** to draw – and that's (almost) all there is :-)\ Play with the different smoothing values to find out what they do.

### Text Tool 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SfkduZ39gsk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  With the **text tool** you can – mmmh, what could it be? – write texts! But watch out: it can create two different kinds of texts. Create **normal texts** by clicking on the canvas and starting to type. These texts can be viewed in any browser.

  **Flow text** can be created by **clicking and dragging** with the text tool. A flow text can currently (SVG 1.1 standard) **only be displayed in Inkscape**. If you would like to use it with a different program (e.g. embed it into a web page to use with a browser), you first need to **convert it to normal text** (this option is available in the `Text` menu as `Convert to Text`).

  You can set the **font and font size** in the tool controls bar.

  Now type something nice :-)


### Copy, Stamp, Duplicate 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhvU-8Edy10?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  **Copy** works in Inkscape as it does everywhere else: with `Ctrl + C`.\ **Paste** will also work as usual with `Ctrl + V`.

  Then there's also **duplication**. Select an object and press `Ctrl + D`. You don't see a difference? Well, that's because the duplicated object **ended up exactly above the original object**. Just drag it away a bit with the mouse, and you'll see the object below.

  **Stamping** is a fun feature, which lets you **stamp copies of an object** all over the place quickly. **Hold** the object with the mouse, then press the `space bar` to 'drop' a copy at the current location. Move the original a bit, then press the space bar again.

### Deleting Objects 

  Whenever you want to **get rid** of an object, **select it**, and then either use `backspace`, `Del` or press `Ctrl + X`. The **right-click menu** ('context menu') also contains a menu item for object deletion.

### Pasting Styles

  <iframe width="500" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/puco6jg_V7w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  This feature is **enormously useful**, so really make a mental note of this keyboard shortcut!\ After you have **copied** an object using `Ctrl + C`, you can **select** a different object and then paste **just the styling** (colors, stroke width, font, font size) of the first object to the second object: **press `Ctrl + Shift + V`.

  Now make the green-blue-yellow rectangle pink-green. Go!

### Changing Colors, Editing Stroke and Fill 

  To **change the fill color**, you can just `click` on one of the color fields in the **palette** at the bottom, when you have selected an object. The **color of its stroke** can be set with `Shift + click`.

When you need to adjust a color **more precisely**, or when you would like to change the style of the stroke (width, dashes), you can use the **'Fill and Stroke'** dialog for this.

  <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLm8qngqpMw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  Open the dialog now. It's all boring grey when there's nothing selected – so better also select an object!

  Now take your time to look at its **three tabs**. The first one is for the **color and type of the fill**, the second one is for the **color of the stroke**, the third one for the **style of the stroke**. Read the tooltips.

  Go ahead and adjust the fill color of the circle! Per default, (I think) the `RGB color setter` is selected – I find it's easier to use the `HSL` color setter or the `color wheel`. Just try them all out to see which color setter suits you best.

  Now adjust the color of the stroke.

  And finally, try to find out how to make the stroke wider (in the third tab). You can also change the stroke's 'pattern' here – how about using some dots?

### Turning Objects into Paths 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb906EL44ow?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  There are a few features in Inkscape, which will **only ever work with paths** – e.g. most path effects and some extensions. But a **text**, a **rectangle** or an **ellipse** are **not paths**, unfortunately, which can lead to a situation in which you really would like to do something, but nothing happens...

  In this case (after having read the hint in the status bar), you will need to **convert the object to a path** first. This means that you will no longer be able to **edit the object in the 'object-typical' manner**, e.g. it's no longer possible to drag on the handles of a rectangle to round its corners, or to continue to write in a text.

  Instead, it is now possible to edit the object with the **node tool**, for example to remove all the holes from the 'O's of a text – or to use one of those extensions or another feature which refuses to work on anything that is not a path.

  Now try this with a rectangle and a text. Before you convert, try to edit them with the node tool. Then convert them to paths, and try the same thing again.\ See? Now you can move the path segments and nodes as you like!

### Group Objects together and Ungroup Them 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po0EKgwCvb8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  Groups are **immensely useful**, but sometimes, they have the habit of being confusing. When multiple objects are **grouped together**, they behave **like a single object**. It is not possible to select one of them directly by just clicking on it, as all you will get is **the whole group at once**.

  This can be used to **order** your drawing, or to **fix the positional relationship between objects**. In a drawing which contains a face, this would help you to prevent you from accidentally moving the mouth out of the face, when both are grouped together. You would still be able to move the whole head, or to rotate it.

  And when you get to the point of starting to play with transparencies, groups will become **really important**.

  Look into the status bar when you have selected the group of rectangles on the right!

  Now ungroup them, and group them again.\ What happens if you double-click on a group? (note the drop down menu in the status bar!)

  You can leave the group again by clicking on any object outside the group, or by double-clicking on a blank space in your document (the animation also shows this, but the double-click isn't really easy to see. Here, too, look at the status bar).

  With `Ctrl + click` you can **always** select any object, no matter if it is in a group or not.

### Changing the Stacking Order (Z-Order) 

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIk9EBEpRj0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  The stacking order was already explained in [Part I of this workshop](http://vektorrascheln.de/posts/2015/Dec/inkscape-fuer-einsteiger-teil-i-grundlagen-en.html##stacking-order). Now you will learn how you can change it.

  Actually, this is pretty easy: Select an object, then press `PgUp` or `PgDown` or use the stack icons in the tool controls bar of the selection tool.\ Now go ahead and restack those rectangles!

### Aligning and Distributing 

  <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKFdWsUoebk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  You will really need this dialog whenever you would like to **neatly align objects to each other**.

  Open it now, and read the tooltips. Note the **drop down menu** at the top. This indicates the **object that is meant to stay in the same place**, while all the other selected objects will be aligned relative to it.

  Now try to build the exclamation mark from those scattered blue boxes (Hint: center vertically! Select multiple objects with `Shift + click` or use the rubberband selection).

## Boolean Operations 

  By using **Boolean operations**, you can create **new paths** from multiple selected objects. This works just like it works in maths: `path + path = new path`. The original paths are gone after the operation, instead there is a new path (or several), which has been created through the calculation. The **stacking order** of the original paths determines the result.

  These operations allow to turn multiple paths into a single one, or to break one path up into multiple paths. To best understand what exactly the effect of each operation is and in which situations it can be employed most efficiently, you will need to **look at them directly**. At the moment, it's not important to memorize each detail. This is more about knowing **that** these things exist. If in doubt, you can simply try it out – and clear up 'accidents' by using the **undo feature**. All Boolean operations can be found in the second section of the 'Path' menu.

### Combine

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uu9hLZdHq_k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  When you **combine** objects, all nodes and paths of all selected paths will be **preserved** and become part of the newly created path.

### Union
  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrRPebYLy1I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  When you **union** objects using `Ctrl + +` (in the gif animation, you can only see that the Ctrl key is being pressed), the new path will be created from the **common outline** of the selected paths.

### Difference

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ANjOoCbTY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  **Difference** punches **holes** that have the shape of the top path into the bottom path. This is why this operation only works (as of Inkscape 0.91) with exactly 2 selected paths.

### Intersection

  <iframe width="500" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AkfMx1aTNBU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  After using **intersection**, only those areas are left that have been covered by each one of the selected paths.

### Exclusion, Division, Cut Path, Break Apart 

  <iframe width="600" height="650" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWoY7PTVuOw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  **Exclusion** will only keep those areas that **do not overlap**. **Division** will cut a path along the borders of the top path, and creates **closed** paths. **Cut path** cuts the bottom path's outline in those places, where it **intersects the top path**. **Break apart** will break a path up into its **subpaths**, where each subpath will become a new object. The keyboard shortcuts for these operations might not work with some international keyboard layouts.

## Where can I find more info? 

  A great source of info is the **official [Inkscape website](https://inkscape.org)**. There you will not only find an **FAQ**, a **keyboard shortcut reference**, links to the **manuals** and the **latest news about the Inkscape project**, but also lots of links to **user forums**, to the **chat**, to the **mailing lists** and to **many different tutorials**.
