## Welcome

Welcome to HEP-CAD, which stands for Haute École Pédagogique [du canton de Vaud] - Computer Aided Design.

In French, there are two terms that translate CAD: DAO for 2D drawing and CAO for 3D modeling. In English, it's all CAD. If you really neeed to distinguish the two, say CAD Drawing and CAD Modeling or 2D and 3D...

This site houses the supportive information and files for ACPR 2.1 and ACPR 3.1 courses that are part of the PIRACEF continuous education program at HEP.

**To get started, click on DAO or CAO menu button...** ☝️
