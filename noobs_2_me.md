## Intro

  This part of the workshop is **hands-on** – so the first thing you need to do now is to 
  
## **[Download the workshop file](#)**
  
   and to open it with Inkscape. Keep your browser window open to be able to switch between the two applications.
   
   SHOW
   If you have a large monitor, I recommend setting the browser to about 1/3 of the screen on a side, and fill the rest with Inkscape.

  SHOW
  If you have a small display, use the keyboard shortcut `cm+tab` to quickly cycle between Inkscape and your browser.
  
  > On Mac, you have to select `Xquartz` for the switching to work.  

  Here in your web browser, you can **read the explanations** and **watch the animations**, while in Inkscape, you can **try out your new knowledge** right away.

  This tutorial is quite long, and contains a really huge amount of information. So we will take a break at _____

## HOWTO properly use the the Animations/ Screencasts

  The screencasts are embedded as YouTube videos, because this provides a flexible and practical **playback options.**

  action            | shortcut
  ------------------|--------------
  pause/ play       | `spacebar`
  jump 5s back      | `left arrow`
  jump 5s forward   | `right arrow`
  speed up          | `shift + >`
  slow down         | `shift + <`
  one frame forward | `.`
  one frame back    | `,`
  fullscreen        | `doubleclick`

  In the screenshots and animations for this article, the **icons** may look different than the standard icons which come installed with Inkscape. Their position, though, is identical, and often the only difference is the color.

  Sometimes, you will also see a German word or tooltip. This is because the author of many of these animations, Moini, is German. In other places, you may see some English. That is because the 2nd author, Filip, is Czech. If you need help, just ask. 

  When you **click on the images**, you can look at a **larger** version – and if you're not using Javascript in your browser, you can just use the **back button** of your browser to return to this page.

## The Inkscape Window

  After you have opened the file, you should be seeing something like this (minus the docked dialog on the right side, as you haven't opened any yet):

  ![Overview about the Inkscape window](/assets/media/inkscape.jpg)

  At the very top of the window, there are the different **menus**, which give you access to a tremendous amount of different functions and dialogs. **Take your time to take a look around**, so you can get a rough first impression of all the possibilities Inkscape has to offer. **Don't be afraid**, even if at first, all these terms you will see may seem confusing!

  The basic functionalities of Inkscape are easy to learn and to use, and at the beginning, you will easily do without most of the cool extra functionalities. On the other hand, it is useful to at least know that they exist, in case you should need them some time.

  Below the menu bar, there is the **bar for quick access to the dialogs** (command bar). From here, you can access all the important dialogs quickly – e.g. the one for **saving**, the one for the **text properties** or the one that allows you to **change fill and stroke**. Furthermore, this bar also contains the buttons for **undoing** and **grouping**. Hover over each button with the mouse cursor and read the **tool tips**, to find out what they are for.

  Below the command bar, you can see the **tool controls bar**. The icons in this bar **change**, depending upon the tool which is currently **active**. Here, too, every field or button shows a tool tip when you point at it with the mouse. Try it out!

  At the left, there is your **tool box**. This is the place where you can choose if you'd like to draw, for example, a rectangle, a circle or if you'd rather like to make a new path. When you've read all tooltips for the tool box, come back here to read on.

  At the very bottom of the window, you can see the **status bar**. In this place, Inkscape displays **different bits of information** for you, of which it thinks they might be useful right now. For example, you can see which **layer** you are currently working on, which **position** the mouse cursor is at right now, which **fill and stroke color** the currently selected object has, and foremost, you always get to see a hint about the currently selected **type of object**, the **number of selected objects**, or about **how to use** the active tool. And if something doesn't work as you expect it to work, you should **always first take a look into the status bar**. Very often, it will give you **precious hints**, that can help you to get to the root of the problem.

  Directly above the status bar, there's the **color palette**. A left-click on one of the colored fields in the palette will change the fill color of the selected objects to that color.

  At the very right of the Inkscape window, there is the **bar for the snap settings**. Right at the beginning, you will probably not need it yet – snapping may even be confusing, as it prevents you from freely moving objects about (as they will often 'jump' to the next possible place where they can snap to). If in your file, like in this screenshot, the uppermost button is activated, **click on it**, to deactivate snapping. Now use your mouse to discover what the snap bar tool tips say.

  To the left of the snap bar, there's the area where **dialogs will dock to**. If at some point of time, a dialog wouldn't open, look here first. It might be that it has been **minimized** by a click on the small triangle in the dialog's top right corner, and can be found **as a small icon** in the dock (as can be seen in the screenshot, the two small icons to the right of the layers dialog).

  The big white area in the center of your screen is the **canvas**. Here you can become creative and do most jobs using your mouse. To its right and directly below, there are the **scroll bars**, which you can use to quickly move around the document. At the canvas' top and to its left you can see the **page rulers**, which allow you to roughly estimate distances and which are used to create **guide lines**.

  Click on one of the two rulers now, hold the mouse button down and drag the mouse on the canvas. Let go of the mouse button. You have just created your first guide line ;-) – if you want to get rid of it again now, just drag it back into the ruler.

## SELF WORK START

  As we now know how to find our way around in the drawing, it's finally time to try out the **tools** and to **change** things in the drawing.

  For this purpose, I have prepared the file in a way that prevents you from changing the important things (text and background images, which are **locked**). I have also added a couple of **example objects**, which you can use to try everything out.

  In this beginner workshop, we will **by no means get to know all tools** – but with this selection you will be able to easily create respectable drawings.

  Using scrolling and zooming, go to the next section, follow along in in the workshop file.
  
  Then come back here to read the corresponding section, watch the animation, and then try out the mentioned functionality in the file by yourself – continue in this manner, jumping back and forth between Inkscape and your browser, until you need a break or have reached the end of this workshop.

  It is NOT enough to just read through about inkscape or watch videos and screencasts.
  
  Only by trying things out you will find out which of the offered options can be useful for you, and it will also be much easier to memorize the new impressions.

  **Let's go!**

Now, Open the workshop practice file, and follow the instructions below. If you cannot make something work, call me, and I'll come and help you.
